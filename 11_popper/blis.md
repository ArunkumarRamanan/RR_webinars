# Popper Tutorial

In this session we will introduce the Popper experimentation protocol. 
We will go over an exercise that makes use of the Popper CLI's 
scaffolding features to create an experiment from scratch and will 
also show how to import an existing experiment and re-execute it to 
verify the replicability of results. We will lastly show how to 
continuously validate an experiment using Jenkins.

> **Note on terminology**: Throughout this talk and exercises, we use 
> the terms repeatability, replicability and reproducibility (of 
> results) as defined by the [ACM's reproducibility 
> policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging).
