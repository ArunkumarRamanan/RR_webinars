* Practical Information
This talk will be given by [[http://khinsen.net/][Konrad Hinsen]] and [[http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/][Nicolas Rougier]].

Conducting research in a reproducible way is often perceived as an
additional difficulty. If such effort is not recognized, the incentive
for doing so is not clear for most persons. Several conferences and
journals have thus started strongly encouraging such practice (artifact
evaluations, companion websites, dissemination platforms, ...) and
some are actually pioneering toward an alternative publication
model. Konrad Hinsen and Nicolas Rougier are both behind the [[http://rescience.github.io/][ReScience]]
journal initiative that targets computational research and encourages
the explicit replication of already published research, promoting new
and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original
research is reproducible.

In this webinar, we will give an overview of the connections between
reproducible research and publication and of the main social and
technical challenges that should be taken into consideration. We will
then present the [[http://rescience.github.io/][ReScience]] initiative and make a demo of [[http://www.activepapers.org/][ActivePapers]]
a possible solution for making computations reproducible and
publishable.
